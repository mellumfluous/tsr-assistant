### Description / Abstract
Outside of their monthly utility bill, most people do not have a strong grasp on the specifics of their electricity consumption. With time-of-use metering and confusing pricing tiers, managing that cost is not a simple task. SEADS Platform(SEADS-P) is a consumer-friendly platform designed to de-obfuscate household electricity usage so that users can see what appliances are consuming the most energy, and empower consumers to make educated decisions about electricity usage. We use a Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) system to detect the userâ€™s power consumption. 

The SEADS device monitors the aggregate electrical signal of the entire household. SEADS-Platform collects this aggregate data and uses machine learning to disaggregate it into separate signals per appliance. The user can view this information through our web dashboard. Our platform also calculates the cost of the electricity use of each appliance.
